Short-term:

- fix ruff / mypy / sphinx
- fix AccommodationSpaceWellCalculator
- use subsidence rate curve instead of subsidence (in meters)
- create simulated well from output xarray
- create output plots (acco/accumulation/topo... vs time) (from well in time or from xarray?)
- Wells: allowing to convert Depth to Age from DepthAgeModel composed of markers linking depth with age. In between markers, assume a function (default is linear)
- create missing unit tests for save methods
- create export methods to save data objects (simulation, realization, scenario, etc.)

Long-term:

- define cost function to evaluate misfit between real and simulated well
- implement multi-real framework from parameter ranges
- implement parameter optimisation
- add (de-)compaction law to restore wells at deposition thicknesses
