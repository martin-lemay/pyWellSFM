# pyWellSFM
pyWellSFM stands for Python Well Stratigraphic Forward Modeling.  This package aims at simulating the deposition of sedimentary layers over time along one or multiple well(s). The deposition of elements is controlled by the accommodation space -split into eustatism variations and subsidence- and the accumulation model.
